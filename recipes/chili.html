        <h6>Bowl of chili</h6>

        <p>
            This chili is one that is loaded with beef and beans and 
            absolutely full of flavor. This easy recipe cooks on the 
            stovetop and is perfect served alongside homemade cornbread, buttered 
            toast or buttermilk biscuits. Add in your favorite toppings like cheese 
            and onions for the perfect meal.
        </p>

        <p>
            When making chili on the stove, I simmer it uncovered which allows 
            the chili to naturally thicken without having to add cornstarch or flour. 
            While thickening chili by simmering is the best option, you may not always 
            have time to let it reduce. If you don't have time to simmer it to thicken
            you can sprinkle in a little bit of cornmeal or make a cornstarch or flour 
            slurry and add it in. If you can spare a few extra minutes, just let it 
            simmer uncovered.
